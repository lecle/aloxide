# Aloxide

While there are a lot of blockchain softwares available and it's not uncommon to see a requirement to support various blockchains, it still requires a significant amount of time to learn how to write a smart contract just printing "Hello World" per blockchain. Aloxide provides a pragmatic abstraction for various blockchain softwares including CAN, EOS, ICON, and so on so that you can focus on business logic on smart contracts without ties to specific blockchain natures. Also based on the abstraction Aloxide offers useful tool-kits for dApp development such as API gateway and SDK.

# Getting started

Check out the [working example using Aloxide API gateway](https://github.com/lecle/aloxide/blob/master/packages/example-api-gateway/README.md).

# How to build

## Development Environment

Aloxide project requires Node.js 10 and above and `yarn` and `lerna` as global depdencies.

```bash
npm i -g yarn
npm i -g lerna
```

## Bootstrap the Project

```bash
npx lerna bootstrap

# Build project
yarn build

# after build project you can
## try unit test
yarn test

## or try start
yarn start
```

Output of the `yarn start` will look like bellow:

```text
lerna run start
lerna notice cli v3.22.1
